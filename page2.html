        WASHINGTON - The Supreme
                Court's conservative majority appeared
                skeptical Friday of the Biden administration's authority to impose a vaccine-or-testing requirement on
                the nation's large employers. The court also
                was hearing arguments on a separate
                vaccine mandate for most health care workers.
                The arguments in the two cases come
                at a time of spiking coronavirus cases
                because of the omicron variant, and the
                decision Friday by seven justices to
                wear masks for the firsttime while hearing arguments reflected the new phase
                of the pandemic.
                Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who has
                had diabetes since childhood, didn't appear in the courtroom, choosing to remain in her office at the
                court and take
                part remotely. Two lawyers, representing Ohio and Louisiana, argued by telephone after recent positive
                COVID-19
                tests, state officials said.
                But the COVID-19 circumstances did
                not appear to outweigh the views of the
                courts six conservatives that the administration overstepped its authority
                in its vaccine-or-testing requirement
                for businesses with at least100 employees.
                &quot;This is something the federal government has never done before,&quot; Chief
                Justice John Roberts said, casting doubt
                on the administration's argument that a
                half-century established law, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, confers
                such broad authority.
                Roberts and Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett probably
                hold the key to the outcome in both
                cases, as they have been more receptive
                to state-level vaccine requirements
                than the other three conservative justices. Barrett and Kavanaugh also had something to do with it.

            see rise in popularity" body="
            <p>
                With the rise in popularity of vaping
                and CBD over the past few years, smoke
                shops continue to open in Onslow
                County, despite the already high number of them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tobacco shops have always been
                around in Onslow, especially with the
                military presence, but as vaping and
                CBD have grown in popularity over the
                past several years, smoke shops continue to open in what could be considered an already
                saturated
                market.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is no longer a privilege license
                requirement for tobacco shops, according to Jacksonville Planning and Permitting Director Ryan
                King,
                so there is no
                record of the exact n umber ofshops currently in operation within Onslow
                County.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite the number of shops in the
                county, some are tobacco vape, some
                are strictly vape, and some sell CBD and
                other items.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many of the shops don't appear to
                have any issues with business, despite
                the competition,
            </p>
            <p>
                &quot;Supply and demand,&quot; said Maxx Tobacco and Vapor store manager Nicole
                Finn. &quot;We sell what people buy every
                day; cigarettes, cigars, lighters, disposable vapes, I mean, it's something thafs
                always going to be sold.&quot;
            </p>
            <p>
                Finn said they haven't even been
                open six months and their business
                keeps getting busier and busier every
                day, She thinks their location on Richlands Highway doesn't hurt.
                However, DiamondTek Vapor manager Jen Stanton said she's over seeing
                so many tobacco vape stores, and she
                feels if a store sells tobacco products, it
                shouldn't be allowed to sell vape
                products.
            </p>
            <p>
                &quot;We have been one of the oldest
                vape stores in this town next to Electra
                Vapor and Vaporland,&quot; Stanton said.
                &quot;Our biggest thing is, as a true vapor
                store, if you go into either this location
                or our location off of Henderson, we
                have no tobacco products. It is strictly
                vape.&quot;
            </p>
            <p>
                Stanton believes most of the vape
                and tobacco stores don't take the time
                to help customers understand what
                they're buying and how to safely use it.
                She said their purpose at DiamondTek
                has been to help people get off smoking cigarettes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tor all of the tobacco vape stores
                that we see, thafs why we have so
                many. They are not a true vape shop,&quot;
                Stanton said. &quot;We're not trying to sell
                you cigarettes, we're not trying to sell
                you a quick convenience thing, and
                that's where all these other places,
                they've ended up being a convenience

            <p>
                Onslow County has received federal
                assistance for its emergency needs
                amid staff shortages and an increase
                in calls.
            </p>
            <p>
                Two fully-staffed FEMA Strike
                Team ambulances from Texas have
                been brought in for duty in Onslow, the
                county s emergency services depart-
                ment announced Thursday.
            </p>
            <p>
                Norman Bryson, director of Onslow
                County Emergency Services, said CO-
                VID-19 has contributed to the issue,
                which he says isn't just a local prob-
                lem.
            </p>
            <p>
                &quot;There is a national shortage in
                EMS staffing and personnel,&quot; Bryson
                said, &quot;With COVID going on, call vol-
                umes are increasing.&quot;
            </p>
            <p>
                According to Bryson, from 2019 to
                2021, Onslow County EMS calls in-
                creased by about 4,000 from roughly
                20,000 in 2019 to more than 24,000 in
                2021. The national shortage of EMS
                staff, Bryson said, is alarming.
            </p>
            <p>
                &quot;lt is starting to become more and
                more concerning with the numbers
                that we are seeing of people being out
                and also people transitioning in the
                workplace,&quot; Bryson said.
            </p>
            <p>
                The extra help was prompted from
                the federal government level following
                a state survey into the county's call
                volume and staffing numbers, Bryson
                said, who noted the assistance came at
                no direct cost to the county, and other
                areas of the state have also received
                FEMA Strike Team ambulances.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bryson said the ambulances will be
                serving the county for at least two
                weeks and his department is working
                to remedy a lack of staffing, which he
                said has been down around 15% from
                normal levels.
            </p>
            <p>
                The two teams on duty are from an
                EMS system out of the Dallas area
                called Medical Jets.
